# Camera-Calibration
Cameras introduces a lot of distortions to images. Due to radial distortion, straight lines may appear
curved. In addition, tangential distortion may cause object to look closer than the real distance. In
order to nd to parameters dening the target camera model, camera calibration will be performed on
checkerboard pattern images taken using target camera.
